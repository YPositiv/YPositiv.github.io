                    Hi, my name is Yurii Popovskyi, I am 27 years old.
                    <br>
                    I was born on May 30, 1993 in a small town. My childhood was very active, and at the age of 15 I became a DJ and started to earn my first money. In 2010 I finished school. From 2010 to 2015, I studied at the Odessa National Economic University. From 2015 to the present day, I am studying in the graduate school of the same university. At the same time I study Front End development. In my free time I write HTML & CSS code, I also like to edit videos, and on holidays I donâ€™t forget to blow the dust off my DJ console and have fun with my friends.
